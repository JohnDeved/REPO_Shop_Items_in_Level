Configure the mod through the BepInEx config file:

### Upgrade Items
| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `SpawnUpgradeItems` | Enable/disable upgrade items spawning in levels | `true` |
| `MapHideShopUpgradeItems` | Whether upgrade items are hidden on the map (Client Only) | `true` |
| `UpgradeItemSpawnChance` | Percentage chance (0-100) for upgrade items to spawn on a valid spawn point | `2.5%` |

### Item Allow List
The mod supports controlling which specific upgrade items can spawn in levels. In the config file, you'll find two sections:
- `[AllowedItems Upgrades]` - Controls which upgrade items can spawn
- `[AllowedItems Drones]` - Controls which drone items can spawn

Each item has its own toggle to enable or disable spawning. These lists include all available items (including modded items) that could possibly spawn.

Please note that you have to start the game with the mod installed at least once to generate the configuration options.

## üîÆ Planned Features
- Support for additional item types
- Custom item distributions based on level difficulty
- Additional configuration options

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### [No config file](https://github.com/JohnDeved/REPO_Shop_Items_in_Level/issues/7)
If you do not see the configuration file, follow these steps:

1. Start the game with the mod installed at least once to generate the configuration file.
2. Check the `\BepInEx\config` directory for the file named `REPO_Shop_Items_in_Level.cfg`.
3. Ensure you are using mod version 1.1.2 or higher, as the configuration file is only generated for these versions.
4. If the configuration file is still not generated, verify the mod version and update if necessary.
