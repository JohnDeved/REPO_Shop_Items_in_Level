![R E P O](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11f842b2-cf3f-4f8f-9df7-52eefbc8cdf7)

## ✨ Overview
This mod enhances gameplay by allowing upgrade items (normally only available in shops) to spawn throughout levels as findable loot. Hunt for valuable upgrades as you explore!

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Multiplayer Friendly**: Only the host needs the mod installed
- **Configurable**: Adjust spawn rates and toggle features to your preference

## ⚙️ Configuration
Configure the mod through the BepInEx config file:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `SpawnUpgradeItems` | Enable/disable upgrade items spawning in levels | `true` |
| `UpgradeItemSpawnChance` | Percentage chance (0-100) for upgrade items to spawn | `5%` |

To generate the configuration file, start the game with the mod installed at least once. The configuration file will be generated in the `\BepInEx\config` directory and is named `REPO_Shop_Items_in_Level.cfg`. Note that the configuration file is only generated for mod versions 1.1.2 or higher.

## 🔮 Planned Features
- Support for additional item types
- Custom item distributions based on level difficulty
- Additional configuration options

## ⚠️ Known Issues
- Currently only supports item upgrades (more item types coming in future updates)
- Upgrades may occasionally spawn in hard-to-reach or inaccessible locations
- Please report any other issues on the GitHub repository

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### [No config file](https://github.com/JohnDeved/REPO_Shop_Items_in_Level/issues/7)
If you do not see the configuration file, follow these steps:

1. Start the game with the mod installed at least once to generate the configuration file.
2. Check the `\BepInEx\config` directory for the file named `REPO_Shop_Items_in_Level.cfg`.
3. Ensure you are using mod version 1.1.2 or higher, as the configuration file is only generated for these versions.
4. If the configuration file is still not generated, verify the mod version and update if necessary.
